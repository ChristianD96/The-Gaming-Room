# The-Gaming-Room
 Software Design Document

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The client for this project was The Gaming Room. This client had a game called Draw It or Lose It which was similar to a 1980s game called Win, Lose, or Draw. The Gaming Room wanted to develop a web-based version of their gaming application, but didn't have the tools or knowledge to set up the enviorment. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
In all honesty I did really well with this entire project. I scored almost perfectly on every aspect, It's hard for me to say which section I did particularly well. I know I felt really good about my recomendationg because I did allot of research, but in the end I worked really hard on every part of this project. I'm proud of the whole piece.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Creating a highly detailed UML Diagram is crucial to developing good code. I referenced my UML Diagram consantly in development and it helped me tremendiously. I spent allot of time ensuring my UML was done correctly and it paid off.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would go back to my evaluation and get more information. My evaluation provided me with some information and I made a good decision based off it, but there is always more to understand about different developmental tools and I would like to make the best decission possible which can only be done with more information. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I knew that what the user wanted was something mostly simple with decent security. I knew they didn't really need or have any specialized requirements and I knew that because of that they didn't need anything fancy. They needed a well balanced server and cost and that was my driving force behind the choice I made. I went with a cheaper well rounded option that fits right in with what my client needed. We have so many wild development tools and special options and choices. Sometimes a client doesn't need the extras. Sometimes the client just needs functionality at a fair price. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
In developing the software I went for the most simple approach. Not by any means did we seek the easy way out, but as I noted above our client had no special requirements and that is why the software design for this project has a logical clear flow that is extremely intuitive. We knew what the client needed and we knew that they had this game previously established and just needed a web version of it. So we essentially were able to copy the ideas and logic and apply it in a new enviorment. In the future I would certainly get more information from my client so that I could better create their application.
